\section{Fuzzy logic}\label{fuzzy logic}
In this section we will describe how our fuzzy logic was implemented and try to
give some arguments for some of the decisions that we made to arrive
at this point.

Our fuzzy logic is divided into three parts. We have the rule parsing which as
the name implies parses a specific set of rules and converts them into a runtime
structure. The runtime structure is tasked with representing the fuzzy logic and
letting other parts of our code interact to get results back. The runtime structure
consists of three parts, the "if statement", the "conditional statement" and
the "fuzzy expression". The fuzzy expression consists internally of fuzzy sets
which contains the knowledge about how rules should be divided into sets of truth
values. The last part of the fuzzy logic is the "reasoner" which contains two 
methods for inference, Mamdani and Sugeno.

\subsection{Runtime structure}\label{runtime structure}
As stated the runtime structure consists of three parts, each corresponding to
a different statement in our rule parsing(see \ref{rule parsing}). To be able
to parse as diverse rules as possible we designed the runtime structure around
the notion of generality. Each rule is broken down into separate pieces and for
each such piece we create a separate runtime structure to keep track of what
is going on. When we evaluate a rule we propagate the necessary information
down trough all the structures before we are left with nothing but fuzzy expressions.

The top layer of the structure is the if statements, these represent individual
rules which lead to a result. The if statement is what the outside world sees
of our structure and it is the only place to interact with. The if statement
consists of conditional expressions which hold either a fuzzy expression or
a concatenation of conditional expressions. The bottom layer of the structure
is the fuzzy expressions which holds the variables and the fuzzy sets to evaluate
those variables against. The fuzzy sets is a structure which can evaluate whether
a value is within its range and if so to what degree. For this project
we support sets representing triangles, trapezoids and simple gradients.

In appendix \ref{example rules} we have an example of what the runtime structure
has to support. The "define fuzzyset" lines defines fuzzy sets as described above.
The lines beginning with "if" represents a complete if statement. An expression
surrounded by pretenses represents either a fuzzy expression or if there is an
and between to such expressions a conditional statement.
