#Comments can be used as long as the line starts with a #
#Each line below must end in an ";"
#All rule statements must be on a separate line and can not breach line boundry

#define can either define a lingvar or a fuzzyset
define lingvar health: bad, ok, good
define lingvar rate: small, medium, large
define lingvar distance: close, near, far
define lingvar action: attack, flee, meh

#Fuzzyset can be wither triangle or trapez as variables
define fuzzyset distance.far: triangle = [0,0,0,0,0]
define fuzzyset health.bad: trapez = [0,0,0,0,0]

#IF rules are of the following form, each fuzzy statement in the if
#can be seperated with each of the following: ["and", "or", "not"]
#When the statement is done, there should follow a "then" and an action
if ((health is bad) and (rate is medium)) then action is flee
if ((health is ok) and ((distance is far) or (rate is small))) then action is meh
if ((distance is small) and ((rate is medium) and (health is good))) then action is attack
