#Comments can be used as long as the line starts with a #
#All rule statements must be on a separate line and can not breach line boundry

#define can either define a lingvar or a fuzzyset
define lingvar health: bad, ok, good
define lingvar rate: small, medium, large
define lingvar distance: close, near, far
define lingvar action: attack, flee, meh

#Fuzzyset can be triangle or trapez as variables
define fuzzyset distance.far: triangle = [0,0,0,0,0]
define fuzzyset health.bad: trapez = [0,0,0,0,0]

#IF rules are of the following form, each fuzzy statement in the if
#can be seperated with each of the following: ["and", "or"]
#When the statement is done, there should follow a "then" and an action

#IF 		= if COND_ST then action is ACTION
#COND_ST 	= (COND_ST [and|or] COND_ST) | (FUZZY_EXPR)
#FUZZY_EXPR 	= LINGVAR [is|not] VAR_NAME
#ACTION 	= VAR_NAME 
#LINGVAR 	= [a-z]+
#VAR_NAME 	= [a-z]+
if ((health is bad) and (rate is medium)) then action is flee
